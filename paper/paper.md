# Summary
[GIBBON](https://github.com/gibbonCode/GIBBON) [@Moerman2017a], which loosely stands for Geometry and Image-Based Bioengineering add-ON, is an open-source MATLAB速 toolbox providing a single open-source framework for many aspects of computational (bio)mechanics such as: image segmentation, meshing, boundary conditions specification, and finite element analysis (FEA). Visualizations for the core functionality are shown in the figure below.

A more detailed discussion of the core functionality and example implementations with links to documentation are next discussed.

* **Image segmentation**: In patient-, or subject-specific biomechanics, the geometry information is often derived from image data (e.g. Magnetic Resonace Imaging (MRI)). GIBBON offers image filtering and smoothening methods, and has a graphical user interface for 3D image segmentation (see `HELP_imx.m`). The segmented image data can be converted to 3D surface models which can be meshed for FEA.
* **Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools**: Sometimes geometry is instead imported or designed. Using GIBBON geometry can be imported from common mesh based CAD files (such as STL, see `HELP_import_STL`). However, several CAD style commands have also been implemented in GIBBON such as polygon rounding, revolution (see `HELP_polyRevolve`), extrusion (see `HELP_polyExtrude`), and sweeping and lofting (see `HELP_polyLoftLinear` and `HELP_sweepLoft`).
* **Surface meshing tools**: Two-dimensional multi-region triangular meshing (See functions like `HELP_regionTriMesh2D` and `HELP_multiRegionTriMeshUneven2D`), resampling meshes geodesically (see `DEMO_geodesic_remeshing`), smoothening (`DEMO_surface_smooth_methods`), and surface mesh refinement (see `HELP_subtri`, `HELP_subTriDual` and `HELP_subQuad`), and mesh type conversions (see `HELP_tri2quad`, `HELP_quad2tri`), and mesh dual computation (see `HELP_patch_dual`).
* **Volumetric meshing**: Tetrahedral volumetric meshing meshing (and constrained Delaunay tessellation) is enabled through an interface with the [TetGen](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/) [@Si2015] package (`HELP_runTetGen`). Hexahedral meshes for some geometry types can be directly coded (e.g. sphere `HELP_hexMeshSphere`, boxes `HELP_hexMeshBox` and lattices `HELP_element2HexLattice`). For general input surfaces mixed tetrahedral-hexahedral meshing is also available (`DEMO_MixedTetHexMeshing`).
* **Lattice structures**: Volumetric and surface conforming lattices
* **Finite element analysis (FEA)**: FEA is enabled by acting as a wrapper for the [FEBio](http://febio.org/) project [@Maas2012]. GIBBON can be used as a pre- and post- processor for FEA as it enables the code based development of meshes, boundary conditions, and input files. FEBio files can be directly exported based on dedicated MATLAB速 structures. Furthermore, GIBBON can be used to start and control FEBio simulations. As such, iterative and inverse FEA (e.g. based on MATLAB速 optimization routines) is also enabled.
* **Visualization**  
GIBBON expands the standard MATLAB速 visualization capabilities by adding 3D image and voxel visualization (see `HELP_im2patch`), meshed geometries (`HELP_XXXX`), finite element models (`HELP_element2patch`), and all visualization methods enable multiple colormaps to be used in each figure or axis window. Furthermore GIBBON offers a custom figure window `cFigure` containing 3D rotation options (`HELP_vcw`) that mimic CAD behavior of 3D scene rendering, and high quality figure exporting options (`HELP_efw`).

To date GIBBON has been used for image analysis and visualization [@Moerman2012a], continuum mechanics[@Moerman2017a], soft tissue biomechanics ([@Cooney2015] [@Takaza2013]), and subject-specific and inverse FEA of soft biological soft tissue ([@Moerman2017a] [@Sengeh2016]). Current research with GIBBON is also focused on subject-specific computational modeling for the automated generation of 3D printable prosthetic devices with optimized and spatially varying mechanical behavior [@Moerman2016c].
