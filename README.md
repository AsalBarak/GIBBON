## Project summary <a name="Summary"></a>
GIBBON (The Geometry and Image-Based Bioengineering add-On) is an open-source MATLAB toolbox by [Kevin M. Moerman](kevimoerman.org) and includes an array of image and geometry visualization and processing tools and is interfaced with free open source software such as [TetGen](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/), for robust tetrahedral meshing, and [FEBio](http://febio.org/) for finite element analysis. The combination provides a highly flexible image-based modelling environment and enables advanced inverse finite element analysis.

## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>  

##### 1. __Installing 3rd party packages__
* **FEBio** FEBio is the finite element solver used by GIBBON. FEBio is not provided with GIBBON user need to download a desired release from the [FEBio website](http://febio.org/) and install it.    
* **export_fig** export_fig is a MATLAB library which GIBBON uses for exporting figures. The export_fig library is available through its [gitHub](https://github.com/altmany/export_fig) page (or the [MathWorks file exchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig)).
Already bundled with GIBBON:
* **TetGen** is a tetrahedral meshing package which is provided with GIBBON. If an alternative release is required visit the [TetGen website](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/), and replace the existing files (in `...\GIBBON\lib_ext\tetGen)` as desired.

##### 2. __Run `installGibbon.m`__  
The file can be found here `...\GIBBON\installGibbon.m` and will add the GIBBON, FEBio, and export_fig path definitions to MATLAB, and will also integrate the help and documentation.

##### 3. __Restart MATLAB__

## Getting started <a name="Start"></a>

##### Access the integrated help
* To access the help documentation from MATLAB click on the HELP browser then click o `GIBBON toolbox` under `Supplemental Software` as shown below. This will open the toolbox help and documentation which is now searchable and integrated just like the rest of MATLAB's help and documentation.

##### Where to find functions and the executable help and demo files
* The `lib` folder contains all GIBBON's functions and the `lib_ext` contains "external functions" i.e. functions developed by others included with GIBBON. The `docs` folder contains the help&documentation, and demo files which when "published" (using MATLAB's publish functionality) create the .html documentation files (found in `docs/html`) which are integrated in MATLAB.  

* The source for the help information for any function `functionName` is named `HELP_functionName`, and Â the source for demos have `DEMO_` as part of the name. Therefore if one is interested in reproducing or starting off from codes in the help and documentation simply start typing code names starting in `HELP_` or `DEMO_` in the MATLAB command window, e.g. `HELP_ind2patch` can be used to generate the help information for the `ind2patch` function. Users can start editing the file by typing `open HELP_ind2patch` in the command window. By publishing (MATLAB publish functionality) the HELP_ or DEMO_ files .html files are created in the `doc\html` folder. As such if users alter/contribute code in the `lib` folder and generate associated `HELP_` or `DEMO_` files, new help and documentation is added. For new help and documentation to become known and visible to MATLAB run the `createHelpDemoDocumentation` function and restart MATLAB.  

* Many of the `DEMO_` files focus on the use of FEBio. The demo `DEMO_FEBio_block_uniaxial_compression` for instance features a simple cube that undergoes a 30% compression. Other demos focus on different load types, single versus multi-step analysis, different materials and inverse analysis (e.g. `DEMO_FEBio_iFEA_uniaxial_01`).
